        <p class="card-text">    Cities are complex systems where people, buildings, and natural elements interact in dynamic ways. These interactions create a unique urban climate that influences temperature, air quality, wind patterns, and water cycles. Understanding these processes is essential for developing healthier, more sustainable, and climate-resilient cities.
stadtklima.ch is dedicated to exploring and explaining the urban climate in Switzerland and beyond. The platform brings together scientific knowledge, monitoring data, and practical insights to make information about the urban atmosphere accessible to everyone interested in how cities influence, and are influenced by, climate. It is designed both for students seeking clear explanations and background information, and for city administrations and professionals who rely on sound data and analysis to support evidence-based planning and adaptation strategies.
The website provides qualitative and quantitative perspectives on the urban climate, describing key processes such as the formation of heat islands, variations in air quality, and the influence of urban structures on wind and humidity. It also offers an overview of existing monitoring networks and data sources that help us observe and understand these dynamics in real time.
By connecting science, education, and practice, stadtklima.ch aims to foster awareness and understanding of how urban environments function under changing climatic conditions. Our goal is to make urban climate knowledge accessible, transparent, and applicable—helping to design cities that are comfortable, resilient, and sustainable for all.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Structure</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The site is structured in three modules or areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Climate Data</li>
            <li>Global Reanalyses</li>
            <li>Downscaling and Applications</li>
        </ul>
        <small class="text-muted">Each starts with an entry page with a very short text and the
            video, then follow 2-4 subsections, typically each with an exercise.</small>
